# Metis SDK Parallel Executor Tests

We appreciate the contributions made by RISE LABS, and our testing is based on the [Pevm](https://github.com/risechain/pevm) project. We have done more optimization work on parallel execution and extended it based on the latest stable version of Reth and Block Executor, but for contract testing, they are almost the same. We love open source and upstream first, and when it's stable, we will contribute it upstream.
